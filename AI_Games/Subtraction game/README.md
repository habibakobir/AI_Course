**🧠 Subtraction Game (Player vs AI)**

**🎯 Game Description**

The Subtraction Game is a simple mathematical strategy game built using Python and Pygame.
There are initially 25 stones on the board.
Players take turns removing 1, 2, or 3 stones.
The player who takes the last stone loses the game!

This version uses the Minimax Algorithm to make the AI play optimally, ensuring a challenging experience for the human player.

**🕹️ How to Run**

✅ Step 1: Install Python

Make sure Python is installed.
To check:
python --version

✅ Step 2: Install Required Libraries

Open your Command Prompt (CMD) and run:

pip install pygame

✅ Step 3: Run the Game

Navigate to your project folder (where main.py is saved):
python subtraction.py

**🧩 Game Rules**

1.The game starts with 25 stones.

2.Players alternate turns.

3.On your turn, you can remove 1, 2, or 3 stones.

4.The player who removes the last stone loses.

5.The AI always plays optimally using the Minimax Algorithm.

**🧠 Algorithm Used**

- Minimax Algorithm

A decision-making algorithm used in two-player turn-based games.

The AI simulates all possible outcomes and chooses the move that maximizes its chance of winning.
