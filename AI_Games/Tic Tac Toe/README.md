# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (Human vs AI)

## 🧭 Description
This is a simple AI-based Tic Tac Toe game developed using Python and Pygame.  
It allows a human player to play against an AI opponent that uses the **Minimax Algorithm** to make intelligent decisions.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Make sure **Python** (version 3.8 or above) is installed.
2. Install **Pygame** library using this command:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   
**Run the game:**

python tic_tac_toe.py

## 🧩 Required Libraries / Frameworks:

Python (3.x)

Pygame

## 🎮 How to Play:

1.The player uses X and AI uses O.

2.Click on a box to place your X.

3.The AI will automatically make its move.

4.The game ends when either player wins or the board is full (Draw).
