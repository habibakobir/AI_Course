# AI Course Project
Welcome to my **AI Course Repository**, created as part of my Artificial Intelligence coursework.  
This repository contains all of my **AI algorithm implementations**, **AI-based games**, and **AI tools exploration projects**.

### 🧩 Purpose of this Course
To gain a strong understanding of Artificial Intelligence concepts by practically implementing algorithms, developing interactive games, and exploring modern AI tools and platforms.

### 🎯 What I Learned
Throughout this course, I have learned to:
- Implement fundamental AI algorithms such as **BFS**, **DFS**, and **A\***. 
- Apply AI logic in game development (e.g., **Tic Tac Toe**, **Chess**).  
- Explore and utilize **AI-based tools** for automation, video creation, and presentation.  
- Understand how theory connects to real-world applications of AI.
