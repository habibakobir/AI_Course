# ðŸ§  Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm

### ðŸ”¹ How the Algorithm Works
Alpha-Beta Pruning is an **optimization of the Minimax algorithm** used in game trees.  
It reduces the number of nodes evaluated by the Minimax algorithm without affecting the final result.  

- **Alpha (Î±):** Best already explored option along the path to the **maximizer**.  
- **Beta (Î²):** Best already explored option along the path to the **minimizer**.  

**Steps:**
1. Start from the root node of the game tree.  
2. Traverse the tree using Minimax logic:  
   - For **maximizer nodes**, update Î±.  
   - For **minimizer nodes**, update Î².  
3. **Prune** branches where the current node cannot improve the outcome:  
   - If `Î± >= Î²`, prune the remaining branches.  
4. Continue until all nodes are evaluated or pruned, and return the optimal move.

### ðŸ”¹ Applications of Alpha-Beta Pruning
- **Two-player games** like Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers.  
- Reduces computation in **game AI**.  
- Works as an optimization over the standard **Minimax algorithm**.

### ðŸ”¹ Time & Space Complexity
| Complexity Type | Value |
|-----------------|-------|
| Time Complexity  | O(b^(m/2)) in best case (b = branching factor, m = depth) |
| Space Complexity | O(m) (recursive stack depth) |

### ðŸ”¹ Example Game Tree
        A (MAX)
       /       \
     B (MIN)    C (MIN)
    /           \
   D (MAX)       E (MAX)
  \             \
  F (leaf)      F (leaf)


Root node:A(MAX)
Leaf node values: F
Number of nodes: 6
Nodes and children:
   tree = {
    "A": ["B", "C"],
    "B": ["D"],
    "C": ["E"],
    "D": ["F"],
    "E": ["F"],
    "F": []
}
# Leaf node utility values
leaf_values = {
    "F": 10  # Example value for leaf F
}

Optimal value at root 'A': 10
Decision path: A â†’ B â†’ D â†’ F(10)
Total prunings: 2
Pruned nodes: None
Optimal value for MAX: 10
Maximizer tries to get highest value, Minimizer tries lowest value
